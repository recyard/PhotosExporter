# PhotosExporter

A simple MacOS app to export the "Photos Library" from the Photos app.

If you're using iCloud Photos, make sure you have downloaded all the original images to your Mac before the export.

This project is originally forked from https://github.com/abentele/PhotosExporter, but I ended up rewriting nearly everything to support Catalina.

This is my first MacOS & Swift project, it fits my personal needs to export the photos with specific requirements, e.g., exporting the originals and modifications, within a time range, and renaming according to the creation date.
