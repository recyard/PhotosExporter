# PhotosExporter

A simple MacOS app to export the "Photos Library" from the Photos app.

If you're using iCloud Photos, make sure you have loaded the images/videos to your Mac before the export. If the images/videos are locally optimized copies, the app will download the original ones then export.

This project is originally forked from https://github.com/abentele/PhotosExporter, but I ended up rewriting nearly everything to support Catalina.

This is my first MacOS & Swift project, it fits my personal needs to export the photos with specific requirements, e.g., export the originals and modifications, select a time range to export, and rename according to the photo creation date.
